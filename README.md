Dhruv Chandna and Luke Flecker's Senior Research Project

Description:
This project uses AI and machine learning to create a more transparent model for calculating insurance premiums, aiming to reduce customer complaints. The model improves the interpretability of pricing calculations, ensuring fairness, accuracy, and building trust in the insurance process.

Setup:
Once you've cloned the repository to your local machine, navigate to the project folder. After that, install the required dependencies by running the command to install the necessary libraries.

Usage:
After downloading all the files, you can go into the src folder and run the models located inside the models folder. To run any model, simply execute the corresponding Python file. You can also access the interactive map by navigating to the gui folder and running the interactive_gui.py file on your local network.

Notes:
This project is still a work in progress, and a final single file for easy use is still being developed.
